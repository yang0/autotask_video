00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,700
On May 7th, President Xi left Beijing to visit Russia. This visit to Russia has two main purposes.

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:24,940
One is to promote bilateral relations. Another significant theme is to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Great Patriotic War.

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:24,940
The Russian government has also announced that President Putin will visit China at the end of August.

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,060
He will participate in the activities commemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan on September 3rd.

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:53,120
So, this year's theme is to reaffirm the correct historical view of World War II.

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:53,120
After the Cold War, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the West not only physically eliminated the Soviet Union but also psychologically erased its traces.

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,680
After more than thirty years of Western propaganda.

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,580
Now, many Europeans.

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,900
Seem to have forgotten that it was the Soviet Red Army that liberated Europe.

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:55,180
A typical example is a public opinion survey in France. In the 1950s, the French people certainly acknowledged the contributions of the Soviet Red Army.

11
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:55,180
As a result, it seems that everyone now thinks it was the United States that defeated Nazi Germany.

12
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,740
Under the rule of King Yu of Qi, he actually...

13
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:07,240
wants to completely erase this history. This is one situation. So under these circumstances, it is important to uphold the correct view of World War II history.

14
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,400
It is crucial. China was actually the main battlefield in Asia during World War II, just as the Soviet Union was the main battlefield in Europe.

15
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,400
But now in Western discourse, it is gradually...

16
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:23,320
starting to simultaneously diminish China's importance and the role of the Soviet Union. So both sides now have common interests and must uphold the correct view of World War II history.

17
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,160
These issues are related to current interests. If...

18
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:36,380
the view of World War II history is overturned, and the historical and legal legitimacy of the Potsdam Declaration is denied...

19
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,740
Well, then many of those...

20
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,340
actions that disrupt the post-World War II order will arise.

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:44,140
Including many Eastern European countries now, right? They completely deny the role of the Soviet Red Army and the sacrifices of the Soviet Union. And then on our side,

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,440
it begins.

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,760
The practical consequence is the denial of the sequence of World War II through multiple party announcements.

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,360
Well, he might.

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Just deny the legitimacy of the country.

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:07,120
And now, it seems that some Americans, some scholars, and later a CIA,

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,420
under the influence of this shareholder, began to deny.

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,100
Resolution 2758.

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It has practical significance, right?

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:11,080
So adhering to the correct historical view of World War II and the post-war international order represented by the United Nations is in the interest of both countries now.

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:20,380
This year, both countries have particularly emphasized the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II. One way to show this emphasis is through military parades.

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,820
Then, of course, this action is.

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,680
Much more significant than those small academic seminars or something.

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,540
Right? Of course, we scholars should also speak up actively.

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,080
We scholars must stand on the development stance of our own country and not blindly follow.

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Don't be misled by the American way. Indeed, but the role.

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
I estimate this parade.

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:49,760
Its role might surpass many, many student seminars, you know? This is probably the primary reason for President Xi's attendance.

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:49,760
The second reason, of course, is to strengthen Sino-Russian relations, right? The world today is very unsettled.

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,420
The United States now relies on its hegemony.

00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,300
They are just bullying us more and more.

00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,720
So.

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,120
Under these circumstances, well, you know.

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,360
Actually, China's interests are being harmed, and so is the world order.

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,440
Under these circumstances.

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:14,840
The relationship between China and Russia is very important, just like Foreign Minister Wang Yi mentioned on March 7th.

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,580
At the press conference, he said.

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,320
The world today is full of changes and uncertainties.

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:30,460
China is a relatively stable factor, and the China-Russia relationship is even more stable. Strengthening this relationship is crucial for global stability.

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,980
In.

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,800
Specifically applied to Chinese diplomacy. Everyone knows that since Trump took office, he has had an idea to ally with Russia against China, right?

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:58,260
It seems he doesn't shy away from it; he just mentioned it publicly, though not as explicitly as in his first term.

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:58,260
In his first term, his strategist was Bannon, Stephen Bannon.

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:58,260
It was publicly stated that the characteristic of Trump's diplomatic team is primarily about two enforcements.

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:58,260
Although joint enforcement logically makes sense.

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,060
In reality, it's quite difficult to achieve.

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,560
But in any case, China is making some efforts, right?

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:19,880
We are making our efforts to stabilize Sino-Russian relations.

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:19,880
Thirdly, specifically, in the context of the U.S. wanting to ally with Russia, we need to strengthen Sino-Russian relations to thwart that idea.

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:28,260
Lastly, we might need to address some specific issues. Sino-European relations are generally stable, but there are certainly many difficulties within.

61
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,140
Ah, we need to address this, for example.

62
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,980
For instance, the trade relations between China and Russia are very good, but now.

63
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:40,060
Friends involved in trade with China. So we encounter a problem, which is the payment between both sides.

64
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,320
Now there is an issue, right? This requires both sides to find a solution together.

65
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,800
Our goods have been sold there and are very popular.

66
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,500
But the money can't come back.

67
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:59,840
So this creates difficulties for subsequent trade, right? Additionally, Russia still has some.

68
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,300
This, this.

69
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,300
Some ideas that we find somewhat abnormal, for example, Russian customs.

70
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:13,360
Often, they are quite strict with Chinese people, right? And they are also quite strict with Chinese companies.

71
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,800
So.

72
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,320
This should be discussed.

73
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,780
This has caused some unpleasant feelings among the people, right?

74
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,500
Therefore.

75
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,820
Hmm.

76
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,640
Through the summit meeting, right? To establish some basic principles.

77
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,620
Uh, to eliminate some.

78
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:46,920
Specific obstacles in Sino-Russian relations, right? This should also be one of the purposes.

79
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:46,920
We believe that through President Xi's visit, Sino-Russian relations in the near future.

80
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,080
Will remain relatively stable, and maintaining stability is something we can expect.

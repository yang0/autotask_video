00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,700
On May 7th, President Xi left Beijing to visit Russia. This visit to Russia has two main purposes.

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:24,940
One is to promote bilateral relations. Another significant theme is to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Great Patriotic War.

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:24,940
The Russian government has announced that President Putin will visit China at the end of August.

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,060
He will participate in the activities commemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan on September 3rd.

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:53,120
So, a major theme this year is to reaffirm the correct historical perspective on World War II.

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:53,120
After the Cold War, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the West not only physically eliminated the Soviet Union but also psychologically erased its traces.

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,680
After more than thirty years of Western propaganda,

00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:58,266
many Europeans now

00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:02,586
seem to have forgotten that it was the Soviet Red Army that liberated Europe.

00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:21,866
A typical example is a public opinion survey in France. In the 1950s, the French people certainly acknowledged the contributions of the Soviet Red Army.

00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:21,866
Now, it seems like everyone thinks it was the United States that defeated Nazi Germany.

00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,426
Under King Yu of the Qi State, he actually...

00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:33,926
wants to completely erase this history. This is one situation. So under these circumstances, it's important to uphold the correct view of World War II history.

00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:46,071
This is very important. China was actually the main battlefield in Asia during World War II, just as the Soviet Union was the main battlefield in Europe.

00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:46,071
But now, in Western discourse, it's gradually...

00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:57,991
starting to downplay China's importance and also diminish the role of the Soviet Union. Both sides now have common interests and must uphold the correct view of World War II history.

00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,831
These issues are tied to current interests. If...

00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:11,051
the view of World War II history is overturned, and the historical and legal legitimacy of the Potsdam Declaration is challenged...

00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,411
Well, many of those...

00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:18,335
actions that disrupt the post-World War II order will start to emerge.

00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:28,135
Including many Eastern European countries now, right? They completely deny the role of the Soviet Red Army and the sacrifices of the Soviet Union. And on our side,

00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,435
it begins.

00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:34,755
The practical consequence is the denial of the Party's multiple announcements and the order of World War II.

00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:36,355
Well, he might.

00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:40,855
Just deny the legitimacy of the country.

00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:51,115
And now, it seems that some Americans, some scholars, and later, under the influence of a certain CA,

00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:54,415
start to deny.

00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,095
Resolution 2758.

00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:00,589
It has practical significance, right?

00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:09,669
So adhering to the correct historical view of World War II and the international order represented by the United Nations after the war is in the interests of both countries now.

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:18,969
This year, both countries have placed special emphasis on the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II. One way to show this importance is through military parades.

00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,409
And of course, this action is much more significant.

00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:27,269
It's far more important than small academic seminars or similar events.

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,129
Right? Of course, we scholars also need to actively voice our opinions.

00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:37,669
We scholars must stand firm on our national stance and not be swayed.

00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,869
We shouldn't be misled by the American rhetoric. Indeed, the impact of this parade.

00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:44,534
I estimate that this parade.

00:03:44,774 --> 00:04:02,694
Its impact might surpass many student seminars, you know? This is probably the primary reason President Xi attended.

00:03:44,774 --> 00:04:02,694
The second reason, of course, is to strengthen Sino-Russian relations. The world today is very turbulent, and.

00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:06,354
The United States is currently relying on its hegemony.

00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,234
They are just bullying people more and more.

00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,654
So.

00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:15,054
Under these circumstances, well, this, this.

00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:19,404
Actually, China's interests are being harmed, and so is the world order.

00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:21,484
Under these circumstances.

00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:29,884
The relationship between China and Russia is very important, just like Foreign Minister Wang Yi mentioned on March 7th.

00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,624
At the press conference, he said.

00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:36,364
In today's world, changes and warming are intertwined, and it's very uncertain.

00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:45,504
China is a relatively stable factor, and the China-Russia relationship is even more stable. Strengthening the China-Russia relationship is particularly important for the stability of the whole world.

00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,024
In.

00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:54,881
Specifically applied to Chinese diplomacy, everyone knows that since Trump took office, he has had the idea of allying with Russia to contain China, right?

00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:15,341
It seems he doesn't shy away from it; he just mentioned it publicly, though not as explicitly as in his first term.

00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:15,341
In his first term, his strategist, Bannon, Stephen Bannon, was quite open about it.

00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:15,341
It was publicly stated that the characteristic of Trump's administration's foreign policy is primarily about two enforcements.

00:04:55,541 --> 00:05:15,341
Although, logically speaking, joint enforcement is challenging.

00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:18,141
In reality, it's quite difficult to achieve.

00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:24,191
But in any case, China is making some efforts, right?

00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:38,511
We are making efforts to stabilize Sino-Russian relations.

00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:38,511
Specifically, in the context of the U.S. wanting to enforce jointly, we aim to strengthen Sino-Russian relations to thwart that idea.

00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:46,891
Lastly, it's about solving some specific issues. Sino-European relations are generally stable, but there are still many difficulties within.

00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:49,771
Ah, we need to address this issue, for example.

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,230
For instance, the trade relations between China and Russia are very good, but now.

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,310
Friends involved in trade with China are facing a problem, which is the payment between both sides.

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,570
Now there is an issue, right? This requires both sides to find a solution together.

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,050
Our goods have been sold there and are very popular.

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,750
But the money can't come back.

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:20,090
So this has caused difficulties for subsequent trade, right? Additionally, Russia still has some.

00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,136
This, this.

00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:27,136
Some ideas that we find somewhat abnormal, for example, Russian customs.

00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:34,196
Often, they are quite strict with Chinese people, right? And they are also strict with Chinese companies.

71
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:35,636
So.

72
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,156
This should be discussed.

73
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:42,616
This has caused some unpleasant feelings among the people, right?

74
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,336
Therefore.

75
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:46,656
Hmm.

76
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:52,476
Through the summit meeting, right? To establish some basic principles.

77
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,456
Uh, to eliminate some.

78
00:06:54,696 --> 00:07:07,756
Specific obstacles in Sino-Russian relations, right? This should also be one of the goals.

79
00:06:54,696 --> 00:07:07,756
We believe that through President Xi's visit, Sino-Russian relations in the near future.

80
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:11,916
Will be relatively stable, maintaining stability is something we can expect.

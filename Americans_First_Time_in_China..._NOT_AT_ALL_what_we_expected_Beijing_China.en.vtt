00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.880
早上好，中国的朋友们，我们现在在北京，&nbsp;

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.080
这座拥有超过2000万人口的超大城市，&nbsp;

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.640
已经有3000多年的历史了，这让我感到非常震撼。&nbsp;

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.600
我们利用了144小时免签过境政策，所以只有几天时间，&nbsp;

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.440
这足够我们初步了解这座城市和这个国家。&nbsp;

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.640
看看这里多美，今天天气也很好，将会是美好的一天。&nbsp;

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.920
我们现在正前往景山公园，据说那里是旧城的最高点，&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.840
可以俯瞰故宫，景色非常壮观。&nbsp;

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.120
来到北京后，我首先注意到的是，&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.040
尽管这是一个拥有众多人口的大城市，但一切却显得非常安静。&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.400
我们正在走一条主要道路，现在大多数汽车都是电动的，这非常棒，&nbsp;

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.680
所以我可以在路边说话，不用担心噪音。&nbsp;

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.040
这让我感到非常惊讶，这里非常安静和平静，再加上所有的绿色植物，这非常漂亮。&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:16.280
[音乐] 好吧，我们刚刚到达景山公园，门票是10元，我读到他们稍微提高了价格，&nbsp;

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.560
因为四月和五月有很多美丽的花朵，所以很明显，&nbsp;

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.480
人们来参观公园，我们一走进去就可以闻到所有的花朵，看到所有的花朵，所以我很高兴来到这里。&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.000
[音乐] 看看这些红色的花朵，它们非常漂亮，它们闻起来很香。&nbsp;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.200
smell all the flowers and see all of the&nbsp;
beautiful flowers so yeah excited to be

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.560

actually an artificial Hill so whenever they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.840
building the Forbidden City and like Excavating&nbsp;
the moat basically they took all of the dirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.400
from the moat and put it in this big pile here&nbsp;
and this hill now looks over the Forbidden City&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.200
so that's how this hill was made it's pretty cool&nbsp;

hello chances are if you're coming to&nbsp;
Beijing you're going to order the duck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.760
so we're in the diman area it's basically&nbsp;
like the road that's leading from where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.360
this morning jingshen Park to the drum and bell&nbsp;
towers that we're going to next and this little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.240
roast duck shop just happened to be like on the&nbsp;
way um and I think a lot of the locals just call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.120
it roast duck they don't call it like peeking&nbsp;
duck or Bing duck they just say roast duck and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.160
the name of the shop is deanan roast deck so so&nbsp;
I was asking our waitress I was like oh can I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.120
get shots of the chef preparing the duck she&nbsp;
pointed behind me right in the entrance door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.080
when we walked in I missed it they have all these&nbsp;
ducks in this refrigerator system they take them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.280
out hang them up outside this fireplace and then&nbsp;
inside you can see there's like 12 of them already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.480
roasting in there and the guy takes them out&nbsp;
with the big hook and hangs them out to cool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.320
off and then one of the guys goes to and cuts&nbsp;
them all up to smell at you guys I am uh pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.640
ecstatic right now so I asked the waitress&nbsp;
what sh she recommends to go with the duck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.440
and she recommend this Chinese salad which we've&nbsp;
never had before it already looks amazing it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.080
some of my favorite things cilantro sesame seeds&nbsp;
noodles looks amazing so you put this one here&nbsp;&nbsp;

right or not I think this might be right the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.680
duck is so salty and juicy and then the sauce&nbsp;
adds like a sweet touch to it and then with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

line to get to some of these duck places but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.920
this is so convenient we just walked right&nbsp;

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.360
can climb the very steep stairs both of them&nbsp;
have very steep stairs so there used to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.440
tradition where at dawn they would I think&nbsp;
ring the bell and then at dusk they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.160
bang the drums hope I got it in the right order&nbsp;
um and so they built these drum and bell towers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.480
all over China the ones specifically here in&nbsp;
Beijing are the biggest in China and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:59.320
